**Course**: DATS 6312 – Natural Language Processing\
**Project**: Edge-Based PII Detection and Censoring System

## Overview

This project aims to develop an edge-based PII detection and censoring system that safeguards user privacy during LLM interactions. The system detects and masks sensitive information such as names, emails, phone numbers, SSNs, and medical data before it leaves the user’s device. We explore multiple NLP approaches including DistilBERT, MobileBERT, and BiLSTM-CRF, alongside regex-based rule models for structured PII. The pipeline includes synthetic data generation, model fine-tuning, evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score, and explainability analysis with SHAP and LIME. The final system is optimized for edge deployment using ONNX Runtime, featuring an interactive demo for real-time PII detection and anonymization.
